# NumPy Pre-processing Operations and Wine Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an assignment on data pre-processing using the **NumPy** Python library. It covers a wide range of operations such as creating and manipulating arrays, slicing, joining, sorting, and generating random arrays. The second part of the assignment involves analyzing the **wine-quality dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Introduction
This project showcases the use of **NumPy**, a powerful library for numerical computations in Python, to perform essential data pre-processing tasks. The assignment also includes statistical analysis of a real-world dataset, the **Wine Quality Dataset**, which helps assess the quality of wine based on various chemical properties.

The goal of this assignment is to:
- Demonstrate proficiency in using NumPy for array manipulation.
- Apply statistical methods to analyze and process data.
- Work with real datasets to gain hands-on experience in data pre-processing.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (3.x)
- **NumPy** - for numerical operations.
- **Pandas** - for data handling.
- **Jupyter Notebook** / **Google Colab** - for writing and running the code interactively.

### Libraries Required:
Make sure to install the following libraries before running the code:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
